# Median filter algorithm


## Introduction
---

### So what is median filter? 
computes the median of all the pixels under the kernel window and the central pixel is replaced with this median value. This is highly effective in
removing salt-and-pepper noise. One interesting thing to note is that, in the Gaussian and box filters, the filtered value for the central element can be a value which may not exist in the
original image. However this is not the case in median filtering, since the central element is always replaced by some pixel value in the image. This reduces the noise effectively. The
kernel size must be a positive odd integer.


## Running
---

Run the following code:
```shell
python medianfilter.py
```

## Process
---

The algorithm developed using self-designed functions and doesnâ€™t take the use of pre-defined median blur methods. 
The algorithm creates a square window of side equal to one given by the kernel size. It works window by window for the complete image
while replacing the values of the central pixel intensities in each case.
The median algorithm shows an effective reduction in noise in the input image with salt-and-pepper noise, and was able to compute the following output with the smallest kernel size of
just 3 pixels (kernel size = 3).

The original input image:

The enhanced image generated by the algorithm:
