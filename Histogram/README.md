# Histogram algorithm


## Introduction
---

### So what is histogram? 
You can consider histogram as a graph or plot, which gives you an
overall idea about the intensity distribution of an image. It is a plot with pixel values (ranging
from 0 to 255, not always) in X-axis and corresponding number of pixels in the image on Y-axis.
This algorithm for creation of histograms, consist of self-designed functions for developing the image of histogram graph drawn using line drawing
methods of OpenCV based on calculations made for the frequencies of all the pixel intensities of an input image.


## Running
---

Run the following code:
```shell
python histofin.py
```
